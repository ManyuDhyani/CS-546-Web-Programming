            <h2>Indus Valley Public School</h2>
            <p>My favourite class was of Computer Science where we use to code, and as soon as we go through the content of the class for the day, we play games on school PCs, like NFS.</p>
            <aside>
                <p>My favourite memory was having lunch between periods. We use to finish our lunch bought from our home in the class and then in recess we used to go school canteen.</p>

            <h2>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technical University</h2>
            <p>My favourite class was of Operating Systems. I really like the concept of semaphores and problems related to critical section. Discussing problems on it like Producer-Consumer, Reader-Writer and Dining philosophers problem was most insteresting part of the class.</p>
            <aside>
                <p>My favourite memory was bunking lectures. We use to make sudden plans to go to malls or restaurant and have good time with tasty food.</p>
